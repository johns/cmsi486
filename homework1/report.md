###  Chapter 1
13\.  Holding official documents in a government building would be an example of a situation where one would need to use a traditional file processing system rather than a database.


14\.  
  1.  The department column in Course table, the course_number column in the Course table, the course number column in the Section table, and both course_number and prerequisite_number columns in the Prerequisite table.

  2.  TODO


###  Chapter 2
3\.  The database schema is the description of the database, whereas the database state is the data in a database in a particular moment in time.


7\.  __Menu-based interfaces for web clients or browsing:__ Using drop down menus allow customers to select the specific command they are looking for. Any website uses this style

__Forms-based interfaces:__ Displays a form that the user would fill out with their own information. Any user trying to submit their information on a database would use this interface.

__Graphical User Interfaces:__ Displays information in a diagrammatic form. This combines menu based systems and form based systems. Any user submitting legal documents or other personal information would use this interface.

__Natural Language Interfaces:__ Uses strings of natural language inputted by the user, and attempts to match the request with data that contains topics from the request string. Users use systems like these when they use google or any search engine.

__Speech Input and Output:__ Speech is inputted, and a response with the data requested is outputted, often in the form of speech. Applications with limited vocabularies use this setup. A user looking for their credit card information over the phone may use this system.

__Interfaces for Parametric Users:__ Users in certain jobs use repetitive operations constantly through the day, and these interfaces make shortcuts and simpler key strokes to reduce the amount of typing these users would need to do. An example of this is a bank teller making a withdrawal from a bank account using software personally made for them.

__Interfaces for the DBA:__ This is the interface for professionals only. They have the right to add, edit, and remove information from the database, as well as reorganize the structure of the database itself. This user it a professional who has a thorough understanding of the database at hand.



14\.  This architecture must be friendly to the common user of a computer, as its purpose (selling airline tickets and making reservations) serves every ‘common user’. Therefore, I would use a GUI interface. In my GUI, I would have drop down menus with options that the user can use to guide themselves throughout the website, and a Forms-based interface for the user to fill in their information, as well as the flight information.


###  Chapter 3
2\.  Tuples in a relation are not ordered, because the elements of a set have no order among them.


5\.  We designate one candidate key in a relation to be a primary key in order to use its values to identify a tuple in the relation.


9\.  A foreign key is a tuple in a relation that references a the same tuple in another relation. This is used to help maintain the consistency of tuples in two relations.


13\.  The Univ_Section# is a good candidate key because it is unique for every entry in the relation. The course number would be a good candidate key, but there might be more than one section of a course which would make duplicate course numbers. They instructor name would also be a candidate key but the only downside to that would be if a professor is teaching more than one course.


20\.
